Variable expansion
 - Quote variables, see Quoting section below.
 - Don't brace-quote single character shell specials / positional parameters, unless strictly necessary or avoiding deep confusion. 
     echo "Positional: $1" "$5" "$3"
     echo "Specials: !=$!, -=$-, _=$_. ?=$?, #=$# *=$* @=$@ \$=$$ ..."
     echo "many parameters: ${10}"
 - Prefer brace-quoting all other variables.


Quoting
  - Always quote strings containing variables, command substitutions, spaces or shell meta characters, unless careful unquoted expansion is required.
  - Prefer quoting strings that are "words" (as opposed to command options or path names).
  - Never quote literal integers.
  - Be aware of the quoting rules for pattern matches in [[.
  - Use "$@" unless you have a specific reason to use $*.
